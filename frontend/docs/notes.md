1. Centralize Types
Goal: All interfaces/types should be in types/index.ts.
Action:
Move any type/interface definitions from screens/components/hooks into types/index.ts.
Import types from @/types everywhere.
2. Reusable Components
Goal: UI elements used in multiple places should be in components/.
Action:
If you have repeated UI (e.g., buttons, cards, tabs), move them to components/.
Example: You already have CategoryTabs, ProductCard, etc.
3. Custom Hooks for Logic
Goal: Shared logic (fetching, filtering, etc.) should be in hooks/.
Action:
If you have filtering logic for favorites/categories, keep it in hooks/useCategoryFilter.ts.
If you fetch data in multiple screens, consider a generic useFetch hook.
4. Shared Styles
Goal: Common styles should be in styles/.
Action:
Move repeated style objects (container, button, text) to styles/commonStyles.ts or styles/buttons.ts.
Import and use these styles in your screens/components.
5. Constants for Static Data
Goal: Static data (like categories, colors) should be in constants/.
Action:
Keep categories.ts and Colors.ts in constants/.
Import from @/constants where needed.
6. Clean Up Screens
Goal: Screens should only handle layout and pass data/handlers to components.
Action:
Use hooks for logic.
Use components for UI.
Keep screens as simple as possible.
7. Remove Duplicates
Goal: No duplicate logic or UI.
Action:
If you see repeated code, extract it to a hook or component.
8. Naming and Imports
Goal: Use clear, consistent names and import paths.
Action:
Use aliases (@/components, @/hooks, etc.) for imports.
Name files and functions clearly.
Example Refactor for Favorites Screen
Before:

Filtering logic and category tabs UI are inside favorites.tsx.
After:

Filtering logic in hooks/useCategoryFilter.ts.
Category tabs UI in components/CategoryTabs.tsx.
Types in types/index.ts.
Categories data in constants/categories.ts.
What to do next?
Pick one screen (e.g., favorites.tsx).
Move any reusable logic to hooks.
Move any reusable UI to components.
Move types to types/index.ts.
Move static data to constants/.
Use shared styles from styles/.
Clean up the screen to only handle layout and data passing.
If you want, paste the code for a specific screen (e.g., favorites.tsx or main.tsx)
and Iâ€™ll show you exactly how to refactor it step by step!

Summary:

Centralize types, hooks, components, styles, and constants.
Keep screens simple.
Extract and reuse logic/UI.
Use clear naming and import paths.
